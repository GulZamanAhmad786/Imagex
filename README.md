# ImageX
We can easily identify any image immediately after seeing it, but it is hard for the computer to do the same. The rapid growth in the availability of the Internet and smartphones has resulted in an increase in usage of social media in recent years. This increased usage has thereby resulted in the exponential growth of available digital images. Therefore, there must be a system that describes the image in human language and performs other actions on images. 
Automatically describing or performing actions on images using natural language is a fundamental and challenging task. With the advancement in computing power along with the availability of huge datasets, building models that can generate captions for an image has become possible. Although great development has been made in computer vision, tasks such as recognizing an object, action classification, image classification, attribute classification, and scene recognition are possible but it is a relatively new task to let a computer describe an image that is forwarded to it in the form of a human-like sentence.

To make our image caption generator system, we will be merging CNN-RNN architectures. Feature extraction from images is done using CNN. We have used the pre-trained model Exception. The information received from CNN is then used by LSTM to generate a description of the image.

# ImageX

ImageX is a Flutter application designed to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals. The project leverages a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for object detection and image processing. The primary goal is to convert images into audio, providing valuable information about the visual surroundings to users with visual impairments.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** The application uses a powerful CNN-based model to detect objects within images, enabling a detailed understanding of the visual content.

- **Image Processing:** Through the integration of RNN architecture, VisioVoice processes images to extract meaningful information, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Audio Output:** The identified objects and processed information are converted into audio, making the content accessible to visually impaired users.
